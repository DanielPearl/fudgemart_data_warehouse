# IST 722: Data Warehouse

<!-- Class and Project Description
  The data warehouse class, taught by Chad Harper and Michael Fudge, focuses on
creating business intelligence (BI) solutions through the construction of data warehouses. This course focuses on designing, implementing, and using databases for the purpose of data analytics. Concepts such as Extract Transform Load for data loading and manipulation are taught using Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services. Data management, data governance, dimensional modeling, and requirements gathering are also highlighted in this class. SQL-Server is used to build the data warehouse on the remote lab. The lab assignments contain each step required for building a complete data warehouse. These steps include filling out a bus matrix for attributes and metrics, structuring the database dimensions and facts, designing the DBMS entity relationship structure, loading data into staging tables, using SSIS to transform and load the data into data warehouses, and building data cubes for faster querying of the data for analysis.
  The project for this class encapsulated the data warehouse steps from the
lab   assignments with the goal of building a fully functional data warehouse and data cube. The data warehouse for this project was created from a fake online market database called Fudgemart. Two entity relationship diagrams were designed to plan out the structures and relationships for each of the databases. Using SQL scripts, these database designs would be used to create the staging and data warehouse databases. Simulating separate servers, the staging database would receive the data as it was in the original schema while the data warehouse contained the transformed structure, ideal for analysis and creating data marts. The data warehouse database was designed using a star schema with one fact table linking to many dimension tables. The staging database was populated using raw SQL while SQL Server Integrated Services (SSIS) was used to populate the data warehouse. This tool extracted data from the staging database, transformed it into the star schema structure, and loaded it into the data warehouse tables. Once the data warehouse was populated, Visual Studio Analytical Services was used to create and populate a data cube to link all the dimensions and their hierarchies together. This hierarchical structuring of the dimensions allows for faster analytical query time. The data cube was then connected to Microsoft Excel and PowerBI to demonstrate the practicality of the database through descriptive statistics.

Learning Objectives
The intention of this class is to gain technical and managerial knowledge of data warehouses in the following ways:  Understand data management, design and implementation of data warehouse structures, differentiate the components of a data warehouse (ODS and data marts), create database objects, distinguish between the Kimball and Inmon approaches to databases, understand the roles and responsibilities in database design, and define database guidelines. The project serves to familiarize students with the steps and concepts required for building a data warehouse. Data warehouses are important for optimizing the way in which data is stored to improve the speed and effectiveness of future analysis. In businesses that use a large amount of data, it is imperative for analysts to effectively utilize the data in order to create insights. Data warehouses organize the data in such a way. Data engineering jobs require individuals to build and schedule ETL data transfers. For many companies, building a usable data warehouse is one of the first essential steps in what it required of a data scientist.  -->
